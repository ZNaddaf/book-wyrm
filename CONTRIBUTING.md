How to contribute to Book-Wyrm

GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

GitHub features are primarily intended for entirely new features to be added, not updates or bug fixes. 

Did you find a bug?
Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under Issues.

If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

If possible, use the relevant bug report templates to create the issue.

Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?
Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. ***Include the relevant issue number if applicable.***

Do not open a new Feature on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change.

Thanks!

Book-Wyrm, Team Finish Strong
